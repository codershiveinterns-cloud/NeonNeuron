    <Section heading="Why we're building NeonNeuron">
      <p>
        Most collaboration tools were designed for a different era — when teams sat in the same
        building and "work" meant being online from 9 to 5. Today, the teams we admire are remote,
        async, and global. Their conversations, files, and decisions need a home that travels with
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started NeonNeuron to give those teams a single workspace where channels, projects, and
        documents live side-by-side — fast enough to disappear, structured enough to scale.

    <Section heading="The team">
      <p>
        NeonNeuron is built by a small, distributed team across four time zones. We're engineers,
        designers, and writers who&apos;ve previously shipped products at companies like GitHub,
        Notion, and Linear. We obsess over the parts of software most people overlook — keyboard
        shortcuts, latency, microcopy, dark mode — because we believe those details add up to
        something that feels meaningfully better.
      </p>
      <p>
        We&apos;re hiring deliberately and slowly. If that sounds interesting, our open roles live on
        our careers page (coming soon).
