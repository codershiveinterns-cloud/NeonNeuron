    <Section heading="1. Overview">
      <p>
        NeonNeuron ("we", "us") provides a workspace for teams to chat, share files, and manage
        projects. This policy explains what data we collect when you use NeonNeuron, how we use
        it, who we share it with, and the choices you have. By using the service you agree to the
        practices described here.
      </p>
    </Section>

    <Section heading="2. What we collect">
      <p><strong>Account information.</strong> When you sign up we collect your name, email
      address, and authentication identifiers (e.g. Firebase UID). If you sign in with a third-party
      provider, we receive the basic profile fields that provider exposes.</p>
      <p><strong>Workspace content.</strong> Messages, files, projects, tasks, and channel
      memberships you create or upload. This content is stored to deliver the service to you and
      your teammates.</p>
      <p><strong>Usage data.</strong> Information about how you interact with NeonNeuron —
      features used, pages viewed, approximate location derived from IP, device and browser type.
      We use this for analytics, debugging, and abuse prevention.</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies.</strong> See our <a href="/cookies">Cookie
      Policy</a> for details.</p>

        <li><strong>Within your workspace:</strong> messages, files, and presence are visible to
          other members of the same workspace and channels you participate in.</li>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> infrastructure, analytics, and email delivery

      <p>We use industry-standard safeguards: TLS for data in transit, encryption at rest for
      sensitive fields, role-based access controls, and regular security reviews. No system is
